It would take 7 iteration to find "G" using linear search

It would take 3 iterations to find "G" using binary search in a sorted collection

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
fib(10) = 55
fib(11) = 89
fib(12) = 144


Finding the 20th Fibonnaci number:
Recursive: (  0.000894)
Iterative: (  0.000004)
Iterative search looks like it's faster at finding fibonnaci numbers

Given that the collection is unsorted, binary search is useless, so I would use an iterative solution to look through
a million items.
I would use an iterative solutions because the recursive solution's performance isn't as good ( in this algorithms) due
to having to call itself multiple times

Given a sorted collection of a million items, I would choose binary search. I would also use a iterative solution due to
better performance

1.
The main data structures are in the form of a classes.
The Pixel class initializes an rgb color with an x,y locator
The screen class initializes with a width an height...as well as a matrix hash to easily locate each pixel

An instance of the Pixel class represents a single pixel.
Colors are validated to be between 0 and 255 using a private method
An instance of the Screen class represents the screen that we are working with.
Hash keys represent a pixel, hash values are the corresponding x,y location...as a 2 member array
Coordinates are validated to be within the height and width using a private method
Developers are able to access and manipulate the data using methods of the Screen and Pixel classes
  ex: methods for:
    creating a pixel in the Pixel class, finding a pixel given its coordinate, inserting a pixel

2.
If a developer wanted to find a specific pixel at a given coordinate in the data structure, they would have to use the Screen#at method.

3.
This structure can also represent a 2-D map with points of interest inserted.

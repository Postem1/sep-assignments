"Spatial Locality" deals with the way that the processor obtains data  from the RAM (and places it in cache)

When the processor access an element in an array, it retrieves an entire range of
locations (near the element) to reduce the number of times it must read from RAM (which takes longer than cache)

If the processor did not know the location of the rest of the members of a
data structure, it could only get one member at a time from RAM
